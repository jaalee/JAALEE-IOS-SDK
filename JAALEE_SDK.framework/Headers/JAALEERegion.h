/*
 *  JAALEERegion
 *
 *  Discussion:
 *    A region containing similar ibeacons.
 *
 *    Such a region can be defined by proximityUUID, major and minor values.
 *    proximityUUID must be specified. If proximityUUID is only specified, the major and
 *    minor values will be wildcarded and the region will match any beacons with the same
 *    proximityUUID. Similarly if only proximityUUID and major value are specified, the minor value will be
 *    wildcarded and the region will match against any beacons with the same proximityUUID and major
 *    value.
